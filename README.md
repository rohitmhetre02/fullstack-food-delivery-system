**FoodFlow** is a dynamic and responsive full-stack food delivery application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It enables users to order food online, make secure payments, and track their orders. An integrated **admin panel** allows authorized personnel to manage menu items, view orders, and perform other administrative tasks.
